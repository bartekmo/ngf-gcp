      The Barracuda NextGen Firewall F-Series fills the functional gaps between
      cloud infrastructure security and a defense-in-depth strategy by providing
      protection where the application and data reside, rather than solely where
      the connection terminates. Because of the isolation between VMs, tenants,
      and virtual networks, the Barracuda NextGen Firewall F-Series operates just
      as if it were a physical device bridging connections between application
      servers in a network DMZ and your ISP’s router.



      Beyond its powerful network firewall, high availability, and VPN
      technologies, the Barracuda NextGen Firewall F-Series integrates
      a comprehensive set of next-generation firewall technologies, including
      Application Control, IPS, anti-malware, network access control enforcement,
      and comprehensive user awareness.



      The Barracuda NextGen Firewall F-Series meets enterprise requirements of
      massive scalability, efficient configuration and lifecycle management
      across dispersed networks, and performance guarantees for business-critical
      applications.

    <p>Barracuda Control Center allows for centralized management of hundreds of

          Barracuda NextGen Firewalls regardless of their location and form
    factor.

          Centrally managed firewalls benefit from shared configuration,
    easy-to-use

          VPN tunnels editor, consistent policies and better administrative
    privilege

          control. One stop monitoring features include central status
    dashboard,

          aggregated logs, statistics and many others.
